# 5. OAuth Client/Application Types

- Two main types:

  - **Confidential Clients**
  - **Public Clients**

  Differentiated by the presence of credentials for authentication.

- **Confidential Clients**

  - Have credentials, typically a **client secret**.
  - Secrets are not visible to users, making them suitable for server-side applications (e.g., Java, DotNet, PHP).
  - Users cannot access the source code, keeping credentials secure.

- **Public Clients**

  - Do not have credentials that can be kept secret.
  - Examples include **mobile apps** and **single-page applications**.
  - Users can view source code or extract strings from binaries, making it impossible to keep secrets hidden.

- **Importance of Credentials in OAuth**

  - Credentials allow the application to authenticate requests to the authorization server.
  - Without credentials, the server cannot verify if requests are from the legitimate application or an impersonator.

- **Authorization Server Behavior**

  - May act differently based on client type:
    - **Confidential clients** may skip consent screens.
    - **Public clients** are at risk of being mimicked by attackers.

- **Client Authentication Methods**

  - Most common method: **Client Secret** (similar to an API key).
  - More secure methods include:
    - **Mutual TLS**
    - **Private Key JWT**
  - These methods are less common and used for higher security needs.

- **Best Practices for Client Developers**
  - Choose the appropriate client type when registering with the OAuth server.
  - Safeguard client credentials if applicable.
  - Never include client secrets in mobile or single-page applications to maintain their confidentiality.

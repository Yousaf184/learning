# 13. Client Credentials Flow

## When to use the Client Credentials Grant

- **Client Credentials Grant Overview**:

  - One of the simplest OAuth grants, involving no user interaction.
  - The application exchanges its own credentials for an access token.
  - No redirects or browser involvement.

- **Purpose**:

  - Intended for applications to obtain an access token without user interaction.
  - Primarily used when accessing the application's own resources, not user data.

- **Use Cases**:

  - Backend requests to microservices.
  - Retrieving app statistics.
  - Example: Google uses it for apps accessing backend storage APIs.
  - Machine-to-machine communication.
  - Verifying access tokens via token introspection endpoint.

- **Advantages of Exchanging Credentials for Access Tokens**:
  - Simplifies API security, as APIs only need to validate access tokens, not client credentials.
  - Reduces the need for APIs to handle client credentials directly.
  - OAuth server is the only entity that needs to validate client credentials.
  - Useful for large-scale deployments with multiple APIs, as APIs don’t need access to a database for client credentials.
  - Can allow validation of access tokens without network traffic, improving scalability.

## Client Credentials Grant flow

1. **Registering the Application**:

   - Register your application at the OAuth server to get credentials.
   - The process varies depending on the server but generally involves creating an application in the developer console.
   - Choose an application type like "machine to machine" or "service account," or an option that provides a client secret (e.g., web app or server-side app).

2. **Obtaining Client Credentials**:

   - After registration, you'll receive a client ID and client secret.

3. **Requesting an Access Token**:

   - To get an access token, make a POST request to the token endpoint with `grant_type=client_credentials`.
   - Optionally include a `scope` if requesting a down-scoped token.

4. **Including Client Credentials**:

   - Client credentials can be sent in the POST body or as Basic Auth in the HTTP header, depending on the server.
   - If in the POST body, include `client_id` and `client_secret`.

5. **Access Token Response**:

   - The response will be the same as any other access token response.
   - Typically, you won't receive a refresh token since there's no user involved to refresh the token.

6. **Using the Access Token**:

   - Once you have the access token, use it to make API requests.
   - The token may have an expiration, but since there’s no refresh token, you can simply make the same request again to get a new token.

# 20. OAuth 2.1

- **OAuth 2.1 Overview**:

  - OAuth 2.1 is a new draft that consolidates the best practices of OAuth into a simpler, more modern spec.
  - It doesn't define new behaviors but gathers existing best practices and recommendations.
  - OAuth 2.1 is intended to simplify OAuth for newcomers by providing a more cohesive starting point, removing the need to sift through older, confusing RFCs.

- **Simplified OAuth Recommendations**:

  - OAuth 2.1 recommends always using PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) and the authorization code flow.
  - It advises against using the implicit or password flows, which have been deemed insecure and outdated.

- **Changes and Additions in OAuth 2.1**:

  - OAuth 2.1 references newer specs that were developed after OAuth 2.0, including:
    - Rich Authorization Requests
    - Pushed Authorization Requests
    - A new spec for defining access tokens using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
  - These are not part of the core spec but are referenced for easier discovery.

- **Security Best Current Practices (BCP)**:

  - The Security BCP included in OAuth 2.1 imposes stricter requirements on OAuth servers, including:
    - Exact redirect URL matching
    - Stricter refresh token management policies
  - These changes mostly affect OAuth server developers rather than client developers.

- **OAuth 2.1 as a "Spec Reset"**:
  - OAuth 2.1 cleans up the older, messy OAuth specifications, providing a more streamlined, modern approach.
  - It aims to reduce confusion for developers by consolidating best practices into a single specification.

# 1. History of OAuth

- **Pre-OAuth API Security**:

  - Before OAuth, APIs commonly used HTTP Basic Authentication, which involved sending usernames and passwords for authentication.
  - Applications needed to ask users for their passwords, store them, and use them in API requests.
  - This method posed significant security risks, especially when third-party applications needed access to user data (e.g., Twitter clients).

- **Problems with Password Sharing**:

  - Services realized the risks and started seeking alternatives to prevent users from sharing passwords with third-party applications.
  - The need for third-party apps to securely access data without requiring passwords drove the search for solutions.

- **Early Solutions**:

  - Different companies introduced their own solutions:
    - FlickrAuth used "frobs" and tokens.
    - Google created AuthSub.
    - Facebook used MD5 signed requests (which was insecure).
    - Yahoo! created BBAuth (Browser-based Authentication).
  - These mechanisms aimed to avoid password sharing but were implemented differently.

- **OAuth's Emergence**:

  - In 2007, the first draft of OAuth 1.0 was published, and it was deployed by companies like Twitter.
  - OAuth 1.0 faced issues, especially with mobile apps, as it was confusing and relied on API keys, which were insecure on mobile devices.

- **Development of OAuth 2.0**:

  - As mobile apps became more popular, OAuth 1.0's limitations became apparent.
  - OAuth 2.0 was developed to address these issues, making the system easier for developers, supporting mobile and single-page apps, and enabling secure use across different platforms.
  - OAuth 2.0 introduced concepts like bearer tokens and the separation between authorization and API servers for scalability.

- **Finalization and Ongoing Improvements**:

  - The OAuth 2.0 specification was finalized in 2012.
  - The IETF Working Group has continued to improve OAuth with extensions like OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps, Device Grant for smart TVs, and the OAuth Security Best Current Practice.

- **Current State**:
  - OAuth is now much more secure and versatile, with updated specs supporting a broader range of use cases.

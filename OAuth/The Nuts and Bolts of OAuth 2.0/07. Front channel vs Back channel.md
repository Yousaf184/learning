# 7. Front Channel vs Back Channel

These terms describe the two different ways the data moves between systems.

- **Back Channel**: The secure, client-to-server connection typically using HTTPS, ensuring encrypted data transit and validation via certificates. It's like **hand-delivering a package** where both the sender and recipient can verify each other's identity.
- **Front Channel**: Data is sent using the user's browser address bar, like **using a delivery service**. There’s no direct link between the sender and recipient, leading to security concerns. This method is more vulnerable to data interception or tampering.

- **Security Concerns with the Front Channel**:

  - The sender can’t be sure the data is safely delivered or hasn’t been tampered with in transit.
  - The recipient can’t be sure the data is legitimately from the sender because return addresses can be easily faked.

- **OAuth and the Front Channel**:

  - OAuth uses the front channel to insert the user’s consent into the process, ensuring they approve the request for an access token.
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) can be added in the front channel, as only the authorization server needs to manage it.

- **OAuth Flow**:

  - The application sends a request (non-sensitive data) via the front channel (browser URL), including the app’s identifier and requested scope.
  - After user consent, the authorization server is ready to send an access token back to the app.
  - **Implicit Flow (Not Recommended)**: Historically, access tokens were sent back via the front channel (redirecting via the browser), but this method is insecure and is now phased out. The risk was that the app wouldn’t be sure the token was delivered securely.

- **Why the Implicit Flow Was Used**:

  - Originally, the implicit flow was used because browsers didn’t support cross-origin requests (CORS), and sending data securely via the back channel wasn’t possible in pure JavaScript apps.
  - With CORS support now widely available, it’s safer to use back channel delivery, making the Implicit flow obsolete.

- **Back Channel in JavaScript**:

  - **Back Channel** doesn’t mean only backend servers. JavaScript apps can also make secure backchannel requests (via AJAX or Fetch), benefiting from encryption and certificate validation.
  - This method is much more secure than sending data via the front channel (browser address bar).

- **OAuth's Evolving Security Guidance**:

  - The latest security guidelines from the OAuth working group discourage the use of the **Implicit flow** due to its inherent security risks.
  - Future updates to the OAuth spec will remove the Implicit flow entirely, reinforcing the use of more secure alternatives.

- **Conclusion**:
  - Understanding the difference between the front and back channels helps in evaluating the security of various OAuth flows and making informed decisions about which flow to use.

# 8. Application Identity

- **Application Identity in OAuth**:

  - In OAuth, applications (or clients) have a unique identity, represented by a **client ID**.
  - The client ID identifies the application during the OAuth flow, ensuring that different applications can be granted different access levels.
  - Some applications (confidential clients) can use a **client secret** (like an application password), while others (public clients) cannot.

- **Authorization Code Flow**:

  - This flow improves security over the Implicit flow by delivering the access token through the **back channel** (secure connection) instead of the front channel (browser).
  - The flow starts with the application redirecting the user’s browser to the authorization server with details about the request (client ID, scope, etc.).
  - After user consent, the authorization server redirects back to the application, but instead of directly sending an access token, it sends an **authorization code** (like a "one-time use coupon").
  - The application uses the **back channel** to redeem this authorization code for an access token.

- **Client Secret and Verifying Application Identity**:

  - The **client secret** ensures that the application redeeming the authorization code is the legitimate one, preventing attacks where stolen authorization codes are used by malicious apps.
  - **Public clients** (like mobile and single-page apps) can’t use client secrets, making it harder to prove their identity and more vulnerable to attacks if the authorization code is intercepted.

- **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)**:

  - **PKCE** is a security extension designed to protect public clients (without a client secret) by generating a unique secret for each OAuth flow request.
  - PKCE ensures that the authorization code can only be redeemed by the same application that initiated the flow, even if the code is stolen.
  - PKCE doesn’t authenticate the application, but it prevents unauthorized use of the authorization code.

- **Redirect URI and Application Identity**:
  - The **redirect URI** is where the authorization server sends the user after login, and where the authorization code is delivered in the front channel.
  - For web apps, this is typically an HTTPS URL, while for mobile apps, it might be a custom URL scheme (e.g., `myapp://redirect`).
  - **Redirect URIs** serve as a form of application identity, especially for public clients (mobile and single-page apps).
  - **HTTPS redirect URLs** are more reliable for proving an app’s identity, but custom URL schemes can be problematic because they are not globally registered.
- **Challenges with Public Clients**:

  - Without a client secret, public clients rely on the **redirect URI** to help confirm their identity, but this method is less secure than using a client secret.
  - Mobile platforms like Apple and Google have started to require app developers to prove control over the domain for URL schemes, but issues remain for mobile and single-page apps without client secrets.

- **Importance of Redirect URI Registration**:

  - Redirect URLs must be **registered** with the authorization server to ensure that tokens are only sent to authorized applications.
  - This registration helps ensure security, even if the application is a public client without a client secret.

- **Looking Forward**:
  - The limitations of public clients without client secrets may change in the future if mobile platforms add more secure authentication methods.
  - For now, careful management of **redirect URIs** is essential for OAuth security.

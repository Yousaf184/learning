# 14. OpenID Connect

## What is an ID token?

- **OpenID Connect Overview**:

  - OpenID Connect is an extension of OAuth, often used together with OAuth.
  - While OAuth focuses on applications accessing APIs, OpenID Connect is about applications obtaining user information.

- **ID Token**:

  - The primary feature OpenID Connect adds is the ID Token.
  - ID Tokens communicate information about the user who logged in to the application.

- **JSON Web Token (JWT)**:

  - ID Tokens are always JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
  - JWT is a token format used for ID Tokens and sometimes access tokens in OAuth.
  - Access tokens can be in any format, unlike ID Tokens, which are specifically defined as JWTs.

- **Structure of ID Token**:

  - ID Tokens are broken into three parts: header, payload, and signature.
  - **Header**: Contains information about the token, such as the algorithm used and key identifier.
  - **Payload**: Contains data about the user, such as their identifier (sub), name, email, etc.
    - Common properties include:
      - **iss**: Issuer (server that issued the token).
      - **aud**: Audience (client ID of the application).
      - **iat**: Issued At (timestamp when the token was issued).
      - **exp**: Expiration (when the token expires).
  - **Signature**: Used to validate the token.

- **User Identifier**:

  - The **sub** (subject) in the payload represents the user's identifier, which can be in various formats (e.g., random string, username, email).
  - The user identifier is stable and unique per user, and your application should not assume its format.

- **Purpose of the ID Token**:
  - The ID Token allows an application to identify users and associate data with them in the backend.
  - It provides a standardized way for applications to learn about users.

## ID tokens vs Access tokens

- **Differences Between Access Tokens and ID Tokens**:

  - Access tokens and ID tokens are **completely different** things with different purposes, despite often sharing the same format (JSON Web Token).
  - **Access tokens** are used by applications to make API requests, and the application doesn't need to understand the access token's contents.
  - **ID tokens** are meant to be read by the application, providing user information.

- **Access Token**:

  - Used by applications to make requests to an API.
  - The application **does not** understand the access token’s contents. It treats it as an **opaque** string (like a hotel key card).
  - The audience of the access token is the **API** or resource server, which interprets the token.

- **ID Token**:

  - Used by applications to learn about the user.
  - The application must **read** the ID token, validate its signature, and interpret the claims (like a passport).
  - The audience of the ID token is the **application**, which is responsible for interpreting it.

- **Format and Audience**:

  - Both tokens may share the same format (JSON Web Token), but the **audiences** are different:
    - **ID token audience**: The application.
    - **Access token audience**: The API or resource server.

- **Token Formats**:
  - Not all OAuth servers use JSON Web Tokens for access tokens.
  - Access tokens could be in various formats, so applications should **not assume** the format of access tokens.
  - **ID tokens** are always JSON Web Tokens, and applications must know how to validate them.

## Obtaining ID token

- **Getting an ID Token**:

  - Applications often need both an access token (for API requests) and an ID token (to identify the user).
  - To get an ID token along with an access token, add the **"openid"** scope to the **authorization code flow** request.

    ```
    https://authserver.com/auth?
    response_type=code&
    client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&
    scope=photos+openid&
    state=XXXXXX&
    code_challenge=PKCE_CHALLENGE&code_challenge_method=S256
    ```

  - The response will include both **access_token** and **id_token**.

- **Authorization Code Flow**:

  - After the user logs in, the application exchanges the authorization code for both the access token and ID token.
  - Since the ID token is received over a trusted back channel (HTTPS), the application doesn’t need to validate the signature or expiration, simplifying the process.

- **Response Type (id_token)**:

  - Alternatively, using **response_type=id_token** in the request returns only the **ID token**, without the access token.

    Server includes the ID token in the redirect URL:

    ```
    https://myapp.com/redirect?code=<ID_TOKEN>&state=XXXXXX
    ```

  - This is similar to the **Implicit flow** in OAuth, but OpenID Connect offers tools to mitigate the associated risks.
  - If using this method, it’s crucial to **validate the ID token** to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.

- **Scopes**:

  - The **"openid"** scope gives basic information (e.g., user ID) in the ID token.
  - To get additional information about the user (e.g., name, email), include scopes like **"profile"** and **"email"**.
  - However, not all OpenID Connect servers include profile information in the ID token; it may require fetching from a **userinfo endpoint** using an access token (check server docs).
  - OpenID scopes:

    - openid
    - profile
    - email
    - address
    - phone

- **Security Considerations**:

  - **Implicit flow** (using **response_type=id_token**) poses security risks, as the ID token is returned in the **front channel** (directly to the browser).
  - It's important to validate the ID token's signature to confirm its authenticity.
  - The authorization server cannot confirm if the application has received the ID token successfully.
  - Sensitive information (e.g., email) should ideally not be sent over the front channel due to the risk of interception. For sensitive data, it's safer to use the **back channel** (authorization code flow).

- **Best Practices**:
  - Always validate ID tokens when received over the front channel (using **response_type=id_token**).
  - Use back-channel methods (authorization code flow) for sensitive data to ensure security.

## Hybrid OpenID Connect flows

- **Hybrid Flows**:

  - **Hybrid flows** in OpenID Connect involve combining different response types (e.g., **code**, **id_token**, **token**) to achieve specific results.
  - Common combinations include:

    - **response_type=code+id_token**: Returns both an ID token and the Authorization code in the front channel, allowing the application to request the access token in the back channel.
    - Response types that use **token** (see list below), e.g. `response_type=token+id_token` use the legacy OAuth **implicit flow** and is generally not recommended to use the "token" in the `response_type` due to security concerns (e.g., risk of access token leakage in the front channel).

      - code
      - ~~token~~ (not recommened)
      - id_token
      - ~~id_token + token~~ (not recommened)
      - code + id_token
      - ~~code + token~~ (not recommened)
      - ~~code + id_token + token~~ (not recommened)

- **response_type=code,scope=openid**:

  - ID token and the Access token will be returned in the response of the request that exchanges Authorization code for an access token.
  - Both tokens returned in the same step
  - No need to worry about validating the ID token because it is received over a trusted connection

- **response_type=code+id_token**:

  - The **authorization code** and **ID token** are returned in the same response, but the ID token comes in the front channel, so it needs validation.
  - The ID token includes a **c_hash** claim, a hash of the authorization code, which helps prevent authorization code injection attacks.
  - This hybrid flow allows for retrieving the **ID token data** earlier in the process, but requires validating the ID token's claims (e.g., signature, expiration).

- **ID Token Validation**:

  - When using **response_type=code+id_token**, the ID token is returned in the front channel, requiring **JSON Web Token (JWT) validation** to ensure its authenticity.
  - **c_hash** helps the client protect itself from authorization code injection attacks, but the authorization server can't confirm if the client is doing this validation correctly.

- **Authorization Code Injection Protection**:

  - **PKCE** (Proof Key for Code Exchange) provides an extra layer of security by protecting against authorization code injection attacks from the server's perspective.
  - PKCE ensures that the authorization code has not been tampered with and is a recommended security measure for both **confidential** and **public clients**.
  - PKCE is the most secure and easiest implementation, recommended by OAuth security guidelines.

- **General Recommendation**:
  - The **most secure option** is to use **PKCE with the authorization code flow** to get the ID token and the Access token. This ensures that both the tokens are securely retrieved.
  - This method minimizes the amount of work required by developers while providing robust security. The authorization server can confirm that the client is protected against authorization code injection attacks, making it the preferred approach.

## Validating and using an ID Token

- **Importance of Validating ID Tokens**:

  - **Critical Validation**: If you receive an ID Token over the front channel (e.g., implicit or hybrid flows), you **must validate** it before trusting its contents to prevent malicious requests.
  - **Front Channel Risks**: Unauthorized users can send bogus ID tokens to your application, potentially compromising security.

- **Steps to Validate ID Tokens**:

  - **Validate Signature**: Ensure the token hasn’t been tampered with by validating the JSON Web Token (JWT) signature.
    - Use the appropriate **key** for signature verification.
    - Use a JSON Web Token library to handle the cryptographic work.
  - **Check Claims**:

    - **Issuer Claim**: Verify the ID Token is from your expected OpenID Connect server.
    - **Audience Claim**: Ensure the ID Token was issued for your application's client ID.
    - **Timestamps**: Validate the **issued at** and **expires at** claims to ensure the token hasn’t expired.
    - **Nonce**: Confirm the **nonce** value matches the one you set during the request to prevent injection attacks.

      (A **nonce** (short for **number used once**) is a random value generated by the client and included in the authentication request when requesting an ID Token. It is used to help prevent replay attacks or injection attacks)

- **After Validation**:

  - Once validated, you can safely use claims like the **subject** (user ID), **email**, **name**, and others (e.g., **AMR** for authentication methods).
  - For applications requiring high security, you can check additional claims like the **last login timestamp** to ensure recent authentication.

- **Back Channel vs. Front Channel**:

  - **Back Channel (Authorization Code Flow)**:
    - When using the authorization code flow to obtain an ID token, most of the validation steps (e.g., signature, issuer, audience) are already taken care of through the secure back channel (HTTPS).
    - You don’t need to validate the token again in this case because it was retrieved over a trusted, secure connection.
  - **Front Channel (Hybrid/Implicit Flows)**:
    - When using front channel flows, **full validation** is required because the token may be tampered with or injected.

- **Revalidation**:

  - If the ID Token is stored (e.g., in a client-side cookie or passed between different parts of the application), **revalidation** is necessary when the token is used later.
  - For tokens passed through untrusted channels, always perform **signature and claim validation** again.

- **Simplified Flow with Authorization Code**:

  - If your application is simply looking to identify a user (e.g., retrieve email or name), **using the authorization code flow** from a trusted back channel is a simpler and safer approach. No additional validation is needed after the token is obtained over this secure channel.

- **Conclusion**:
  - Always validate an ID Token if it comes from an untrusted source, and ensure to revalidate it if it’s passed between different application components or stored for later use. The authorization code flow simplifies validation by handling most security concerns through the back channel.

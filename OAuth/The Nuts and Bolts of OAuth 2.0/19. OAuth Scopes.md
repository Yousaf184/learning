# 19. OAuth Scopes

## Purpose of OAuth Scopes

- **Definition of Scope**:

  - Scopes in OAuth are used to request limited access to specific parts of a user's account.
  - Without scopes, an application would have full access to all operations available in the API.

- **Purpose of Scopes**:

  - Scopes allow applications to request specific permissions, like reading data but not writing data.
  - They limit what actions an application can perform on behalf of the user.

- **User Consent**:

  - When an application requests scopes, the user is shown a list of permissions that the application will have access to if they approve.
  - The access token issued will be tied to the granted scopes, defining the application's level of access.

- **Scopes vs. Permissions**:

  - Scopes are not the same as roles, permissions, or user groups within your API. They only control what an application can do within the bounds of the user's account.
  - For example, admin users might have broader permissions in the system, but OAuth scopes determine the limited access granted to applications, even for admin users (e.g., read-only access to the catalog).

- **Clarification on Permissions**:

  - OAuth scopes don't implement or manage user permissions or roles (e.g., consumer vs. admin). These permissions are handled separately within the system.
  - Scopes only limit the specific actions an app can take based on the granted access by the user.

- **Summary**:
  - Scopes are a tool for restricting the level of access an application has to a user's data, not for managing permissions or roles in your API.

## Defining Scopes for an API

- **Defining Scopes**:

  - There are no strict rules for defining OAuth scopes; it is entirely up to the developer.
  - Scopes are strings passed in URLs and interpreted by your API.
  - Scopes help limit what an application can do within a system, enhancing security and user awareness.

- **Common Scope Design**:

  - Scopes are typically short lowercase strings, often separated by underscores (e.g., GitHub’s convention).
  - You can add more structure using colons or URL patterns if your API is complex.
  - Documenting scopes for app developers is essential to make them aware of the scopes required for different API methods.

- **Distinction between Read and Write scope**:

  - A common first set of scopes is to distinguish between "read" and "write" access. This ensures an application can request either read-only or write access to a user’s account.

- **Enforcing Scope Restrictions**:

  - OAuth itself doesn't enforce scope restrictions; it’s the API’s responsibility to interpret the scope and apply access controls.

- **Advanced Scope Use Cases**:

  - **Sensitive Information**: If API methods deal with sensitive data (e.g., credit card info), create new scopes to restrict access.
  - **Separate API Areas**: For large APIs with unrelated parts (e.g., Gmail, YouTube, Google Calendar), each section may have its own set of scopes, ensuring apps can only request access to specific areas.
  - **Billable Resources**: APIs that charge users (e.g., AWS for creating servers) should have dedicated scopes to ensure users are aware of any potential charges.

- **Flexibility in Scope Design**:
  - The choice of scopes depends on the API and what makes sense for the specific context. The key is to balance security, usability, and user awareness.

## Prompting the User for Consent

- **Purpose of Scopes in OAuth**:

  - Scopes are used to ask for user permission, ensuring that the user is aware of what the application is requesting access to.

- **Consent Screen**:

  - The consent screen prompts the user to approve the requested scopes before access tokens are granted.
  - It's important to describe the requested scopes clearly to avoid overwhelming the user, while ensuring they understand what they are granting.

- **Challenges in Describing Scopes**:

  - Providing a clear but concise description of each requested scope is essential.
  - Too much information can overwhelm the user, leading them to approve access without fully understanding the request.

- **Scope Representation**:

  - Each requested scope should be represented on the consent screen with a brief description to help the user understand the request.
  - Example: GitHub shows which scopes will be granted, such as access to personal data and public repositories.

- **First-Party vs Third-Party Apps**:

  - For first-party apps (built by the same organization as the API), consent screens are typically unnecessary.
  - For third-party apps (built by other developers), consent screens are crucial to protect users from potentially malicious apps requesting unauthorized access.

- **Security Considerations for Public Clients**:

  - For public clients (apps without a client secret), it may be necessary to show a consent screen even for first-party apps to ensure the app’s identity is verified.
  - This helps prevent impersonation and ensures the user is aware of the permissions granted.

- **Best Practices for Consent Screens**:
  - Define appropriate scopes, avoid requesting unnecessary scopes, and ensure the text on the consent screen is clear and informative.
  - The goal is to inform the user without overwhelming them, ensuring they understand what data or actions the app can access.

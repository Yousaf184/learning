# 4. Roles in OAuth

- **User**: The person with the account.
- **Device**: The user's device (mobile phone or browser).
- **Application**: The app running on the device or accessing the app via the browser.
- **API**: The system where the data is stored and accessed.
- OAuth introduces a new role: **Authorization Server**, which manages access to the API by issuing access tokens.

- **OAuth Terminology**:

  - **Resource Owner**: Instead of "User."
  - **User Agent**: Instead of "Device."
  - **OAuth Client**: Instead of "Application."
  - **Resource Server**: Instead of "API."
  - OAuth uses precise terms, but for ease, these can be used interchangeably in most cases, though "Application" may cause confusion in some contexts.

- **OAuth vs. Traditional Authentication**:

  - Traditional methods like cookie-based authentication involve the user typing a password into the device, which sends it to the application to get a session cookie.
  - OAuth improves on this by allowing third-party apps to access data without the app seeing the user's password.

- **Authorization Server's Role**:

  - The **Authorization Server** manages user access to APIs. It authenticates the user, then issues an access token to the app.
  - The app uses this access token to make API requests, instead of sending the userâ€™s password.
  - The user only types their password at the authorization server, not the application.

- **OAuth Token Flow**:

  - The user logs in at the authorization server.
  - The application receives an access token from the authorization server.
  - The app uses the access token to access the API (resource server), where the token is validated.

- **OAuth Architecture Variations**:

  - The roles of the authorization server and resource server can be combined in smaller systems where the API and OAuth server are part of the same codebase.
  - In larger systems, there may be an external authorization server, and multiple microservices act as resource servers.
  - An API gateway can help organize microservices into a clearer structure where everything behind the gateway is a resource server.

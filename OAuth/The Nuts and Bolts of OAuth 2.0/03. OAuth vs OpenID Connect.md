# 3. OAuth vs OpenID Connect

- OAuth and OpenID Connect are related but serve different purposes and have different security considerations.
- OAuth is designed for granting applications access to APIs without needing to know who the user is.

- **OAuth Analogy (Hotel Check-in)**:

  - OAuth can be likened to checking into a hotel: the front desk (authorization server) verifies the user's identity and gives them a key card (access token), which grants access to rooms (resources).
  - The room door (resource server) only cares about the key card (access token), not the userâ€™s identity.

- **OAuth Functionality**:

  - OAuth allows an application to access resources (e.g., upload a file to Google Drive) without needing to know who the user is.
  - OAuth issues access tokens to allow access to APIs, but it does not provide user identity information.

- **Need for User Identity**:

  - If an application needs to know who the user is (e.g., to display their name or profile photo), OAuth alone is insufficient.
  - OpenID Connect extends OAuth by adding user identity information to the flow.

- **OpenID Connect Overview**:

  - OpenID Connect builds on OAuth by adding a mechanism to communicate user identity through a new type of token: the **ID Token**.
  - While OAuth issues **access tokens** for API access, OpenID Connect issues **ID tokens** to convey user identity.

  - OAuth is focused on accessing APIs, and OpenID Connect is focused on identifying users.

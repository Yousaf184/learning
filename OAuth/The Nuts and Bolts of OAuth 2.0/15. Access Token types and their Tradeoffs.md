# 15. Access Token types and their Tradeoffs

## Reference Tokens vs Self-Encoded Tokens

- **Types of Access Tokens**:

  - **Reference Tokens**: Random strings pointing to external data, which holds the actual information (e.g., in a database or cache like Redis).
  - **Self-Encoded Tokens**: Tokens that contain data in the string itself (e.g., JSON Web Tokens, which store details like user, application, expiration time, etc.).

- **Reference Token Implementation**:

  - Can be stored in a relational database or caching systems like Redis.
  - The token itself does not carry meaning but points to data (user ID, token lifetime, scopes).

- **Self-Encoded Token Implementation**:

  - The token contains the data within the string.
  - Data can include user ID, application, expiration time, creation time, scopes, and more.
  - Can be implemented using various methods to encode, sign, or encrypt the data.
  - **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)** are a common format used for self-encoded tokens.

- **OAuth and Access Tokens**:

  - OAuth treats access tokens as opaque strings that the application should not interpret.
  - Only the API cares about the format and structure of the token, not the application.

- **Token Data**:

  - The self-encoded token may include information such as:
    - User identity
    - Application details
    - Expiry and creation timestamps
    - Scopes granted
    - Authorization server and login data.

- **Token Formats and Standards**:

  - **JWTs** are widely used for self-encoded tokens, and there are standards for how to implement them.
  - However, they are not the only option for self-encoded tokens.

- **API vs Application Perspective**:
  - The application does not need to understand the token's content (opaque string).
  - The API is the only party that requires the token's structure to validate and interpret its data.

## Pros and Cons of Reference Tokens

- **Reference Tokens Overview**:

  - A reference token is a random string that points to a record in a database, and the string itself holds no meaningful data.

- **Advantages of Reference Tokens**:

  - **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand. The process of creating, managing, and revoking tokens is straightforward.
  - **Data Security**: Sensitive data associated with the token can be hidden in the database and is not exposed to the application or user. This is more secure than self-encoded tokens, where data may be visible if not encrypted.
  - **Easy Token Management**: Deactivating users or revoking tokens is simple, as it involves deleting records in the database associated with a user ID or application.
  - **Controlled Visibility**: Only the authorization server can access the sensitive data linked to the token, ensuring it’s hidden from both the application developers and the resource server.

- **Disadvantages of Reference Tokens**:
  - **Storage Requirements**: You must store active tokens in a database. As the number of users, applications, and token lifetimes grow, the storage needs can become overwhelming, although storage costs are relatively low.
  - **Validation Overhead**: Since the token string itself has no meaning, APIs must query the database to validate it. This can be inefficient, especially at scale.
  - **Scaling Issues**: As the system scales (multiple APIs or data centers), the need to query a central database for token validation may become a bottleneck. Token introspection (HTTP-based validation) can help, but it still adds complexity.
- **When to Use Reference Tokens**:

  - Best for relatively small-scale APIs or systems with a built-in OAuth server.
  - If scaling is not a primary concern and the architecture can handle the validation overhead, reference tokens are a good option.
  - If data security and hiding sensitive token information are important, reference tokens are preferable.

- **Scaling Challenges**:
  - For larger, more distributed systems, the need to query a central database to validate tokens can become a problem. Token introspection can alleviate some of these concerns but introduces its own complexities.

## Pros and Cons of Self-Encoded Tokens

- **Self-Encoded Tokens Overview**:

  - A self-encoded token contains data directly within the token string itself, meaning the token string holds meaningful information.

- **Advantages of Self-Encoded Tokens**:

  - **No Need for Storage**: Self-encoded tokens do not need to be stored in a database since they contain all necessary data for validation. This simplifies token management.
  - **Scalability**: Since there’s no need for shared storage, self-encoded tokens are more scalable, especially for distributed systems with multiple APIs or data centers. APIs can validate the token by inspecting it directly without needing to query an external database.
  - **Independence from Authorization Server**: Self-encoded tokens are ideal when using an external OAuth server (like Okta). APIs only need to know how to validate the token, without depending on a shared database for token validation.

- **Common Implementation - JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)**:

  - JWTs are commonly used as self-encoded tokens. They consist of a JSON string with a signature attached, which makes them self-validating.

- **Drawbacks of Self-Encoded Tokens**:

  - **Token Visibility**: Data within a self-encoded token, such as user information, is not encrypted (unless specifically implemented). This means anyone with access to the token can decode and view its contents using base64 decoding.
  - **No Revocation Before Expiration**: Once a self-encoded token is issued, it cannot be revoked until it expires. For example, if a user or application is deleted, the token will still be valid until it expires, creating potential security risks.
  - **External Revocation Handling**: To address revocation, some OAuth servers (like Okta) maintain state on top of the JWT and use token introspection to check token validity over the network. However, APIs looking directly at the token will not have this information unless they make an introspection request.

- **When to Use Self-Encoded Tokens**:

  - Best suited for larger-scale APIs or systems where scalability is crucial.
  - Especially beneficial when using a separate OAuth server (like Okta) since it reduces the need for shared storage and simplifies validation.

- **Key Considerations**:
  - While self-encoded tokens offer significant scalability benefits, the visibility of token data and the inability to revoke tokens before expiration are important factors to consider when designing a system.

# 16. JWT Access Tokens

## Structure of a JWT Access Token

- **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) as Access Tokens**:

  - **Self-encoded Tokens**: JWTs are commonly used as self-encoded tokens, where the token itself contains data that can be used for validation, without the need for external storage.

- **Structure of a JWT**:

  - **Format**: A JWT is composed of three parts separated by dots:
    - **Header**: Contains metadata, such as the signing algorithm and key.
    - **Payload**: Contains claims (data) like user info, token issuance details, etc.
    - **Signature**: Ensures the integrity of the token and its payload.
  - **Encoding**: The first two parts are base64 encoded JSON, while the third part is the signature. JWTs are typically signed but not encrypted, meaning the data is visible (though encoded) to anyone who has access to the token.

- **Claims in JWT**:

  - **Reserved Claims**: The JWT specification defines several standard claims:
    - **iss (Issuer)**: Identifies the OAuth server that issued the token.
    - **exp (Expiration)**: Specifies the expiration time of the token (Unix timestamp).
    - **iat (Issued At)**: Timestamp when the token was issued.
    - **aud (Audience)**: Identifies the intended recipient/resource server.
    - **sub (Subject)**: Identifier of the entity the token represents (e.g., user or client ID).
    - **client_id**: The client ID of the application that requested the token.
    - **jti (JWT ID)**: A unique identifier for the token to prevent reuse.
  - **Optional Claims**:

    - **Scope**: Specifies the scope of access granted by the token.
    - **auth_time**: The timestamp when the user last authenticated (useful for time-sensitive operations).
    - **acr (Authentication Context Class Reference)**: Example usecase is if the access token was issued when the user was already logged in at the server instead of confirming their password, this would be 0 and it shouldn't be allowed to do any operations that have monetary value like purchasing.

    - **amr (Authentication Methods Reference)**: Describes the authentication methods used (e.g., password, fingerprint).

      (**acr** and **amr** are from OpenID Connect.)

- **Customization of Claims**:

  - OAuth servers can add custom claims to JWTs, such as user attributes (e.g., groups, name, email) or other context-specific data, which can vary depending on the application and its policies.

- **Standardization of JWT Claims**:

  - There has been a push to standardize the use of claims in JWTs, particularly through the **JSON Web Token Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens**, which formalizes how JWTs should be used as access tokens for better compatibility with off-the-shelf libraries.

## Remote Token Introspection

- **Remote Token Introspection**:

  - Remote token introspection allows an API to check whether an access token is valid by making a request to the authorization server.
  - This method involves an HTTP POST request to a token introspection endpoint, which will verify the token's validity.

- **How it Works**:

  - **Token Introspection Endpoint**: APIs use the token introspection endpoint, typically documented or available through the server's metadata URL.
  - **POST Request**: The request sends the token as a parameter ("token") to the introspection endpoint.
  - **Response**: The server responds with a JSON object containing an "active" property (true or false), indicating the token’s validity.

- **Authentication for Introspection**:

  - The introspection call usually requires authentication, which may involve using registered credentials (client ID/secret) for the resource server.
  - However, this authentication method can vary between OAuth servers.

- **Token Properties in Response**:

  - If the token is invalid, the "active" property will be false.
  - If the token is valid, "active" will be true, and additional information may be provided, such as expiration or audience.
  - The response may contain properties that are already verified by the OAuth server, such as the expiration date, which is informational for the API.

- **Advantages of Remote Introspection**:

  - The validation process is handled by the authorization server, so the resource server doesn't need to handle token formats or validations itself.
  - This reduces the complexity for the resource server.

- **Disadvantages of Remote Introspection**:

  - **Latency**: Every request requires a network round trip to the authorization server, adding latency to API responses.
  - **Geographic Scalability**: For APIs deployed across multiple regions, relying on remote introspection centralizes the OAuth server, which can be inefficient and cause delays.

## Local Token Validation

- **Local Validation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**:

  - Local validation is a fast method of validating access tokens without network traffic, as it happens entirely on the server.
  - APIs are responsible for validating access tokens; applications don’t need to validate them before making requests.

- **JWT Structure**:

  - A JWT consists of three parts: the header, the payload, and the signature.
  - The header and payload are Base64 encoded JSON. These are decoded to inspect the token content.

- **Validating JWT Header**:

  - The header includes information about the signing algorithm and, optionally, a key identifier (kid).
  - It’s essential to only accept known signing algorithms, rejecting insecure ones like "none."
  - To validate the signature, a known signing algorithm should be hard-coded and used consistently.

- **Public Key for Signature Validation**:

  - OAuth servers typically publish their public keys and issuer identifier in a metadata URL.
  - The metadata includes a `jwks_uri` pointing to a URL with public key data. The key identified by the `kid` in the header is used to verify the token signature.

- **Verifying the Signature**:

  - Use a JSON Web Token library for signature validation, as cryptography code should not be written manually.

- **Verifying Claims**:

  - After validating the signature, check the claims in the token:
    - **iss (Issuer)**: Ensure the token is issued by the correct OAuth server.
    - **aud (Audience)**: Ensure the token is intended for your resource server.
    - **iat (Issued At)**: Ensure the token hasn’t been issued in the future.
    - **Expiration**: Ensure the token has not expired.
  - Additional claims might be present, like scope or user group data, depending on server configuration.

- **Limitations of Local Validation**:

  - Local validation only confirms the token was valid at the time it was issued, not if it has been revoked or modified since then.
  - Potential issues like user account deletion, application deletion, or user group reassignment can invalidate a token before its expiration.
  - The token’s validity is based on the state of the system when the token was issued. Token lifetime is a critical factor in ensuring authorization decisions are made based on up-to-date information.

- **Token Lifetime Considerations**:
  - Short token lifetimes ensure data is not outdated but increase the frequency of validation.
  - Longer lifetimes risk making decisions based on outdated or changed information.

## Best of both worlds: Using an API Gateway

1. **Pros and Cons of Token Validation Methods**:

   - **Local Validation**: Scalable and fast but can lead to decisions based on stale data if access token lifetimes are too long.
   - **Remote Introspection**: Provides stronger security but adds latency to every API request due to network traffic.

2. **Hybrid Approach**:

   - The solution is a hybrid method that combines local validation (fast) with remote introspection (secure).
   - The goal is to balance performance with security.

3. **Using an API Gateway**:

   - An API gateway is placed in front of all backend APIs to handle incoming requests.
   - It performs **local validation** for speed, quickly rejecting obviously invalid tokens (e.g., expired or malformed tokens).
   - However, local validation doesn't detect revoked tokens that haven't expired yet.

4. **Handling Revoked Tokens**:

   - If access tokens have a short lifespan (e.g., one hour), the backend APIs will only deal with tokens that were valid within the last hour.
   - For non-sensitive operations (e.g., retrieving rewards points), local validation is often sufficient.
   - For sensitive operations (e.g., financial transactions), the backend API should perform **remote introspection** to verify the token’s validity and check if it’s been revoked.

5. **Benefits of the Hybrid Approach**:

   - The API gateway handles most of the traffic quickly using local validation.
   - Backend APIs handle fewer requests and can perform slower but more secure remote introspection only when necessary.
   - This reduces the overall number of introspection requests, improving performance.

6. **Alternative to API Gateway**:

   - This approach can also be implemented with frameworks that use middleware to validate tokens locally, and only perform remote introspection when needed for added security.

7. **Summary**:
   - The hybrid approach allows for quick validation with local checks while still leveraging the full security of remote introspection for sensitive operations.

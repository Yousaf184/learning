# 2. How OAuth improves security?

- **Traditional Authentication Methods**:

  - Applications often use a simple username and password prompt for authentication.
  - This method works well for simple systems but becomes limiting when handling multiple apps or implementing single sign-on (SSO).

- **Challenges with Single Sign-On**:

  - When multiple apps (including third-party ones) share the same user database, users would have to provide their password to each app, which poses significant security risks.
  - Third-party apps collecting passwords for access to APIs is a major concern.

- **User Concerns**:

  - Users cannot always trust apps asking for their passwords, especially third-party apps, as they might misuse or store passwords insecurely.
  - If users give their password to an app, it can access much more than intended (e.g., change account settings, read sensitive data).
  - Revoking access from such apps would require changing the password, which impacts all other services.

- **API and Developer Concerns**:

  - APIs that handle passwords directly cannot distinguish between legitimate app requests, making it difficult to secure.
  - Attackers might exploit password dumps to access user data.
  - Adding security measures like multifactor authentication (MFA) is challenging because all apps need to be updated, which slows down development and scaling.

- **How OAuth Solves These Problems**:

  - OAuth uses a redirection flow: users authenticate via the OAuth server, never sharing their password with the app.
  - This eliminates trust issues with third-party apps and provides better security for first-party apps.
  - MFA can be added at the OAuth server, allowing all applications to benefit without needing individual updates.

- **Key Benefits of OAuth**:
  - Reduces the number of places where users input their passwords, enhancing security.
  - Simplifies adding new security features like MFA, making them effective across all connected apps without requiring changes to each app.

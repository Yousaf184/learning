# 17. Token Lifetimes

## Increased security using short token lifetimes

- **Access Token Lifetimes**:

  - There is little guidance in OAuth specs about token lifetimes; it depends on the specific system you're building.
  - The duration of access tokens impacts system performance, especially if every token requires validation via the authorization server.

- **Local Validation vs. Authorization Server Lookup**:

  - Using **local validation** (i.e., checking the token itself) avoids the need for a network or database lookup, improving performance.
  - However, tokens may become invalid before their expiration if only validated locally, especially if they are revoked.

- **Impact of Token Lifetime**:

  - **Shorter access token lifetimes** increase security by limiting the window of time an API could improperly accept an invalid token (e.g., due to user or application deletion).
  - Short lifetimes also mitigate the impact of leaked tokens by reducing the time they are usable.

- **Security Considerations**:

  - Shorter access tokens minimize risks such as token leakage (e.g., through vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting or improper storage).
  - Unlimited or long-lived access tokens are considered highly risky.
  - Reducing access token lifetime limits the potential damage from leaked or misused tokens.

## Improved User Experience with Long Token Lifetimes

- **Balancing User Experience and Security**:

  - **Short access token lifetimes** improve security but can negatively affect user experience.
  - A balance is needed between **security** (short token lifetimes) and **user experience** (minimizing disruptions).

- **Using Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens**:

  - **Refresh tokens** can improve the user experience by allowing the app to silently obtain new access tokens without user intervention.
  - **Short access tokens** (e.g., 10 minutes) may require frequent refresh requests, causing disruption (e.g., in mobile apps or single-page apps).
  - **Longer access tokens** reduce disruptions but increase the security risks if tokens are leaked.

- **Disruptiveness of Token Renewal**:

  - Mobile apps can use refresh tokens effectively without user disruption, but the **refresh token lifetime** should be longer to avoid frequent interruptions.
  - In single-page apps, **full-page redirects** for token renewal can disrupt the user experience, so longer access token lifetimes are preferred.
  - The more **disruptive** the token renewal process is (like opening a browser on mobile), the **longer the access token lifetime** should be to minimize user annoyance.

- **OAuth Session vs. Token Lifetime**:

  - The **session lifetime** on the OAuth server doesn't necessarily determine the access and refresh token lifetimes.
  - Refresh tokens can be **short-lived**, even if the user is always logged in to the OAuth server, to ensure that access tokens are fresh and the app interacts with the server.

- **Summary**:
  - Longer access and refresh token lifetimes improve **user experience** by reducing interruptions like redirects or pop-ups.
  - However, longer lifetimes come with **security trade-offs**.
  - The approach to token lifetimes should be chosen based on the platform and user experience needs, balancing **security** and **usability**.

## Contextually choosing Token Lifetimes

- **Token Lifetime Trade-offs**:

  - Short access tokens improve security, while long token lifetimes improve user experience.
  - Striking a balance is key, and this can vary depending on the situation.

- **Customizing Token Lifetimes**:

  - You can customize token lifetimes based on different criteria, such as:
    - **Application Type**: Different policies for single-page apps vs mobile apps.
    - **Trust Level**: Adjust lifetimes based on how much you trust the developer of the app, particularly with third-party apps.
    - **User and Group-Based Policies**: Token policies can vary depending on the user, their group, or the granted scope.

- **Example: Admin Users**:

  - High-risk users (e.g., admins with powerful access) might have shorter token lifetimes (e.g., 1-hour access tokens, 24-hour refresh tokens).
  - Security measures could include requiring a password input daily and using multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure the user is present.

- **Example: Consumer Users**:

  - For less sensitive apps (e.g., consumers browsing products), longer token lifetimes are preferable for a smoother experience, like unlimited refresh tokens and up to 24-hour access tokens.
  - After the access token expires, the refresh token silently updates the access token without disturbing the user.

- **Security Considerations During Sensitive Actions**:

  - For high-risk actions like checkout, you may want to enforce stricter security measures.
  - **Scope-based Policies**: Implementing scopes (e.g., a "checkout" scope) ensures only authorized operations happen under certain conditions.
  - Example: Access tokens for checkout operations may last only 4 hours with no refresh token. This ensures that the app requires the user to authenticate again for sensitive transactions, like placing an order.

- **OAuth Flow Adjustments**:

  - Developers must manage OAuth flows to ensure proper token lifetimes:
    - For regular activities, use longer-lived access tokens.
    - For sensitive operations (like checkout), initiate a new OAuth flow to obtain a short-lived token with the appropriate scope.

  This approach provides a good balance between user experience and security, adapting based on the specific context of the action being performed.

# 18. Handling Revoked or Invalidated Access Tokens

## Reasons why an Access Token may become invalidated

- **Revoked Access Tokens**:

  - Access tokens can expire before their normal expiration time for several reasons.
  - Reasons for early invalidation include:
    - **Account Deactivation**: An administrator or the user themselves can deactivate an account, which invalidates any issued access tokens.
    - **Application Access Revocation**: Users can revoke access to applications through security settings, making any tokens associated with that app invalid.
    - **Password Change**: Changing a user's password may invalidate their existing access tokens.
    - **Policy Changes**: Admins may implement new policies that shorten token lifetimes and invalidate current tokens.

- **Implications for Applications**:

  - Applications are given an **expires_in** value when an access token is issued, which indicates when the token is expected to expire.
  - This **expires_in** value is a hint, not a guarantee, and access tokens can become invalid before that time.
  - **Handling Token Expiration**:
    - Applications should be prepared for the possibility that a request using an access token might fail.
    - If the access token has expired, the application can attempt to use a **refresh token** to get a new access token. If the refresh token fails, the app must prompt the user to log in again.

- **Implications for APIs**:
  - The **API** needs to validate access tokens since the client application might not know if the token has expired early.
  - Access tokens are meant to be read and validated by the API, not the client.
  - The API must ensure that it does not return data for invalidated tokens.
  - The client may only have the **expires_in** value, so it's important for the API to manage token invalidation and reject requests from clients using invalid tokens.

## Problem with Local Validation

- **Token Revocation and API Validation**:

  - **Revoked Tokens**: Applications do not have access to information about whether an access token has been revoked. It's the responsibility of the API to handle this.
  - **Self-Encoded Tokens (JWT)**: If using self-encoded tokens (like JSON Web Tokens), local validation can be done for speed and concurrency, but it can't detect token revocation because the revocation status resides in the OAuth server.

- **Local vs. Remote Validation**:

  - If local validation is used (without checking with the OAuth server), the API may return data based on an expired token, even if the token was revoked earlier.
  - To detect token revocation, the API would need to query the OAuth server, but doing so on every request could slow down performance.

- **Example of Token Validation**:

  - **Scenario**: A token is valid for 8 hours, and the API returns data based on this token. However, if the user deactivates the application or an admin deactivates the user before the token expires, the application might still use a token that should no longer be valid.
  - This creates a situation where the API may inadvertently respond to requests with a revoked token.

- **Judgment Call for API Developers**:

  - There’s no perfect solution for token validation. It's a **judgment call** based on the specific needs of the API.
  - Some API methods may be less sensitive and more acceptable to respond to with a revoked token (e.g., read-only or less important data), while others require strict validation.

- **Example: Banking App API**:

  - **Sensitive vs. Non-Sensitive Methods**: For a banking app:
    - **Non-Sensitive**: Methods like returning a summary of accounts might tolerate responding with a revoked token because it’s less likely to reveal new information.
    - **Sensitive**: Methods like transferring money should never run with a revoked token for security reasons.
  - **Strategy**: API developers can use **local validation** for less sensitive operations and **remote validation** (via OAuth server) for sensitive operations like money transfers.

- **Tradeoffs in Validation Approach**:
  - The decision to use local or remote validation depends on the API operation's sensitivity and frequency.
  - A mix of both methods (local for non-sensitive, remote for sensitive) can balance speed and accuracy.
  - Ultimately, the approach depends on the **risk tolerance** and the specific nature of the API being built.

## Token Lifetime considerations

- **Effect of Token Lifetimes on Revoked Tokens**:

  - Different token lifetimes can significantly impact how an API handles revoked tokens.
  - Long-lived tokens pose a risk because once issued, their state is fixed, and the API can't be sure if the token is still valid, especially if the system state changes (e.g., a token is revoked).

- **Challenges with Long-Lived Tokens**:

  - If the API relies on local validation (checking the token contents without consulting the OAuth server), it cannot verify if a token has been revoked.
  - With long token lifetimes, the API may continue responding to requests even if the token has been revoked.

- **Using Shorter Token Lifetimes**:

  - Shorter token lifetimes (e.g., 5 minutes) help reduce the risk of responding to revoked tokens.
  - After a short token expires (e.g., 5 minutes), local validation would immediately detect that the token has expired, making it less likely the API will respond to a revoked token.

- **Trade-off of Short Token Lifetimes**:

  - While short token lifetimes help with security, they may not be ideal since they require more frequent refresh token usage, which can impact the user experience.
  - A balance must be struck between **security, speed, and usability** when choosing token lifetimes.

- **Balancing the Trade-offs**:
  - Shorter token lifetimes reduce the burden on the API to validate tokens but come with the trade-off of potential usability concerns.
  - The choice of token lifetime is one of the tools available to developers when balancing these factors.

## Revoking Tokens by Logging out of Application

- **Application-Initiated Token Revocation**:

  - An access token can be revoked before its expiration by the application itself, particularly when a user logs out.
  - The application can revoke tokens by sending them to the OAuth server's revocation endpoint.

- **Revocation Process**:

  - When an app uses the revocation endpoint, the OAuth server is responsible for revoking the access token and associated refresh tokens.
  - This helps clean up tokens after the user logs out, ensuring they don't remain valid.

- **Voluntary Action by the Application**:

  - The application must voluntarily initiate token revocation. It's not automatically required when the user logs out.
  - If the application is deleted (e.g., from a phone), the server cannot rely on the app to revoke the tokens, so the server still needs to manage token expiration policies.

- **Impact on Associated Tokens**:

  - Revoking a refresh token typically revokes all associated access tokens and other refresh tokens that were created with it.
  - Revoking an access token may or may not revoke the associated refresh token, depending on the OAuth server's policies.

- **Behavior Consistency in the API**:

  - From the API's perspective, once a token is revoked, it behaves the same whether it was revoked voluntarily by the app or for other reasons.
  - The API can check the revocation status when the token is used again.

- **Best Practice for App Developers**:

  - It's a good practice for application developers to proactively notify the OAuth server that they are done with tokens when the user logs out to ensure proper cleanup.

- **Documentation and Server Policies**:
  - OAuth servers may have different behaviors regarding how revoking access or refresh tokens affects associated tokens, and this should be detailed in the server's documentation.
